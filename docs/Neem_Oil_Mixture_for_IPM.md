### Neem Oil Mixture for IPM: 

### I spray this mixture once/week to keep soft-bodied insects (aphids, thrips, mites, etc.) away from my cannabis plants. To get rid of an infestation, I use an organic pesticide like Lost Coast Plant Therapy, Venerate or Trifecta 3x/week for 1 week, then 2x/week for 1week and then I go back to using my own mixture. 

I don’t recommend spraying your plants after week 2 of flower. DO NOT use neem oil on outdoor gardens\! It kills other soft-bodied insects, like bees and butterflies, that are in danger of extinction.  

### 

1. ### Mix Soap and Water:

Oil and water don’t mix so you will need an emulsifier. Mix 1 teaspoon of dish soap per 1 gallon of (warm) water. Diluted liquid soap works as a [homemade garden pesticide](https://www.thespruce.com/homemade-flower-garden-pesticide-1316079). It kills aphids and other soft bugs. 

2. ### Add Neem Oil:

Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of neem oil and mix it well. 

3. Turn your lights down or off for at least 4 hours:

It’s best to spray right before lights out. If you spray your plants under the hot light, the oil and water droplets will burn your leaves. 

4. ### Spray:

Spray the bottoms of all leaves, stems, and then tops. Make sure they are soaked. Don’t worry about your soil, this won’t hurt it.

## Tips: 

* Avoid spraying new seedlings with neem or they could burn too.   
* Make small batches and use up the spray within a week.   
* Bugs hate peppermint too. Use a peppermint liquid soap as your emulsifier, or add a few drops of peppermint essential oil.
